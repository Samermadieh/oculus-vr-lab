# VR Lab for Oculus Quest 2
I created a Virtual Reality application for the Oculus Quest 2 using Unity and C# that allows the user to experience different aspects of Virtual Reality. The application includes a virtual environment, virtual hands, ability to grab and interact with several objects in different ways, and some fun objects to play with. The full project is on my Github. The APK can be installed on your Oculus Quest 2 for testing. The following video also demonstrates the application.
